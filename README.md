# HACKTRACE – TechNOVA  
**A Cybersecurity OSINT Challenge | Organized by CyberSec Club, Atria Institute of Technology**

---

## 🎯 Objectives

HACKTRACE was built as a hands-on cybersecurity challenge rooted in **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)** methodologies. Designed for the TechNOVA tech fest, the event sought to:

- Introduce participants to real-world cybersecurity reconnaissance scenarios.
- Raise awareness about the implications of digital footprints and public data exposure.
- Educate on how OSINT techniques are leveraged in ethical hacking, red teaming, and threat analysis.

Participants investigated a fictional character through a web-based simulation, uncovering hidden clues from platforms like portfolio websites and social media profiles. The broader aim was to simulate a threat intelligence environment while advocating for cybersecurity hygiene and online privacy.
